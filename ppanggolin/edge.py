class Edge:
    """
    The Edge class represents an edge between two gene families in the pangenome graph. It is associated with all the
    organisms in which the neighborship is found, and all the involved genes as well.

    Methods:
        - get_org_dict: Returns a dictionary with organisms as keys and an iterable of the pairs in genes as values.
        - gene_pairs: Returns a list of all the gene pairs in the Edge.
        - add_genes: Adds genes to the edge. They are supposed to be in the same organism.

    Fields:
        - source: A GeneFamily object representing the source gene family of the edge.
        - target: A GeneFamily object representing the target gene family of the edge.
        - organisms: A defaultdict object representing the organisms in which the edge is found and the pairs of genes involved.
